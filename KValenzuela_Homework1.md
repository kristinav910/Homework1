# Venmo: Easy payments and cash replacement
by Kristina Valenzuela
## Overview and Origin

* Venmo

* When was the company incorporated? <br><br>
Venmo was incorporated in 2009. It received it's first seed money in 2010, was acquired in 2012 by Braintree. Braintree was acquired a year later by PayPal.

* Who are the founders of the company?<br><br>
Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?<br><br>
The college friends wanted a simple way to split restaurant costs and other casual payment needs for friends.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?<br><br>
Their first seed money was $1.2 million, and then they were purchased by Braintree for $26.2 million. The purchase by PayPal in 2013 was for $800 million, but this included all products and brands of Braintree. 

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?<br><br>
As our world is rapidly becoming a cashless society, making casual payments with friends and acquaintances is becoming very difficult. Splitting a bill or gas for a night out is tough when your friends never have cash with them. Likewise, small charities, local organizations, and neighborhood yard sales need a simple method for collecting funds. Few people readily have cash available, and even fewer keep checkbooks on hand.  

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)<br><br>
Originally, the intended customer was the technocentric millenial looking to share costs with friends. That was the main purpose for the social aspect of the app, showing others what each user has purchased, though amounts are hidden. This social function and visibility into what items are being purchased offers Venmo unique insight into user behavior and additional data, though it does pose a security risk. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)<br><br>
Venmo's stack overflow listing is extensive. They use almost 30 tools including Python, Javascript and Google Analytics. They recently created QuizTrain to assist them with testing iOS products written in Swift. They use Python, and a number of linting tools to check for and correct errors in the code. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?<br><br>
They are in the payments sector, however, they are also competing in the personal banking arena, as many banks are competing with them by partnering with Zelle.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?<br><br>
Mobile payments have increased rapidly over the last decade. They have become an expected service in many areas that used to be cash only, such as craft fairs and local PTOs. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?<br><br>
Zelle, Square Cash App, GooglePay, ApplePay/AndroidPay, Popmoney, Facebook

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?<br><br>
Venmo helped to transform user behavior and changed expectations for the public on being able to operate seamlessly without cash. wv 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?<br><br>
Main metrics are number of users. The company is a leader in number of users and transactions. Revenue is indirect, as it comes from fees to credit card companies and businesses offering it as a POS option. 
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?<br><br>
Zelle is it's largest competitor, but their setup is different. Zelle links directly within banking apps, so they have a larger average transaction amount. The average amount for Venmo is $10, while Zelle shows a $300 average. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)<br><br>
The current limitations on Venmo are the amount of money that can be sent and the fact that they are linked to personal accounts only, so businesses cannot use it directly. I would suggest the addition of business payments and increasing the limit on the dollar amount to be paid. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?<br><br>
Since Venmo makes a percentage of the payment, dealing in larger amounts will allow it to quickly generate revenue. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?<br><br>
I don't think the technologies would be very different. There may need to be some additional integrations to connect to back office ERP sites for businesses. There will need to be a strong amount of due diligence into any licensing or regulatory restrictions that could arise from working with businesses. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?<br><br>
Most businesses use an ERP for all of their back office accounting. The accounts payable team will want to be able to track all payments in one system.
